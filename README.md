Sales Analysis

For a video demonstration, please see the 'Demonstration Video' file.

This project is a analysis of sales data conducted for Panier Quebecois, a Montreal startup that is an 'online farmer's market' operating since 2020: https://panierquebecois.ca/en/

Panier Quebecois asked to answer a few business questions based on the sales data:
1 - 


To answer these questions, I used Pandas dataframes in Python Jupyter, and a mix of descriptive statistics, linear regression and logistic regression. 
These calculations are shown in 'Calculations - Promo Codes - Demo' and 'Calculations - Products - Demo'.
Neural nets were also attempted but not used in the final analysis, as shown in 'Calculations - Products - Demo'.

To present the findings, I used Dash by Plotly to build a presentation page. The code for this is in 'Plotly'. A demonstration is in the 'Demonstration Video' file.
